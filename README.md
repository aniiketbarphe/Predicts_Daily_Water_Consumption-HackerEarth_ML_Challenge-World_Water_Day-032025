# Predicts_Daily_Water_Consumption-HackerEarth_ML_Challenge-World_Water_Day-032025

Smart water monitoring systems
Max. score: 100
Water scarcity is an increasingly global issue, with urban households playing a major role in water wastage due to inefficient consumption habits. Traditional water meters provide only total usage data without insights into consumption patterns, making it difficult for homeowners to optimize their water usage effectively. Smart water monitoring systems, powered by machine learning, can help households predict their water consumption and adopt conservation measures.

Task

The goal of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model that predicts daily water consumption for individual households based on historical usage patterns, household characteristics, weather conditions, and conservation behaviors.
